# Hybrid-Cryptosystem
## Independent Implementation of AES

a. The Encryption key will be provided by the user as an ASCII string. The
key will be of length 16. Your program must handle keys of any other size.
Implement the key scheduling algorithm as described in this link.

b. Encryption: The program will encrypt a block of text of 128 bits with the
keys generated in the previous step.

c. Decryption: Decrypt the encrypted text blocks and observe if they match
with the original text.
d. Report time-related performance in the code


## Independent Implementation of RSA

a. Your program will at first generate the key pairs (both public and private)
with an input of K (Take K = 16, 32, 64,128).

b. Take plain text as input and encrypt it character by character.

c. Decrypt the ciphertext and match it with the original plain text.

d. Report time-related performance in the following format:

K               Key-Generation                 Encryption                 Decryption
